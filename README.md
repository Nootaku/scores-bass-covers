# Scores for Bass

### Information
This repository contains a collection of scores that I've transcribed over time when learning new songs.<br>Although I have been the one to write the scores, I want go give credit to the original artists and bass players I've gotten my inspiration from. Everything will be listed below.

***IF YOU POSSESS THE RIGHTS OF A SONG LISTED BELOW*** and you want me to remove the access to the score I have written for the song. Feel free to contact me as I have no problems removing a song.

Feel free to use my scores if you want to learn one of the songs. However, do not go against any local or global copyright laws.

Final piece of information:<br>
All songs have not been scored identically. For some sets I've played live, I just needed the chords and lyrics. Hence they are chords sheets.<br>
For others it is a full score (score + tab).

***This list and the files will have to be updated still.***
