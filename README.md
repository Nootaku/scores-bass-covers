# Scores for Bass

### Information
This repository contains a collection of scores that I've transcribed over time when learning new songs.<br>Although I have been the one to write the scores, I want go give credit to the original artists and bass players I've gotten my inspiration from. Everything will be listed below.

Feel free to use my scores if you want to learn one of the songs. However, do not go against any local or global copyright laws.

Final piece of information:<br>
All songs have not been scored identically. For some sets I've played live, I just needed the chords and lyrics. Hence they are chords sheets.<br>
For others it is a full score (score + tab).

***This list and the files will have to be updated still.***
