# Scores for Bass

### Information
This repository contains a collection of scores that I've transcribed over time when learning new songs.<br>Although I have been the one to write the scores, I want go give credit to the original artists and bass players I've gotten my inspiration from. Everything will be listed below.

##### LEGAL
The intent of this repository is twofold:
1. Centralized storage of the scores I have written for easy personal access.
2. Help musicians to find inspiration and / or learn a song *(esp. for songs that cannot be found on mainstream websites like [Songsterr](https://www.songsterr.com/), [Ultimate-guitar](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) or [GuitareTab](https://www.guitaretab.com) ==> This is also why the current repository contains mainly asian J-Rock songs)*.
 
By no means do I intend to sell, or otherwise personaly benefit from publishing the transcription work that I have done.

> ***IF YOU POSSESS THE RIGHTS OF A SONG LISTED BELOW*** and if you want me to remove the access to the score or otherwise disagree with the content of this repository, please contact me.

Musicians:
- Feel free to look at the score, but please do not download them.
- Think of this repository as a score-book that your friend owns: You can read through the book but you wouldn't take it back home.
